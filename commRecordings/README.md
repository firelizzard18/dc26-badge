Binary Comms Recordings
======

# About
These are binary files, which were generated by storing the bytes read from the
UART while badges are connected.  You will probably want a hexeditor to read
these files.  If you are on windows, I recommend HxD.  On other OSs, the
command line should have a hexdump tool.

# Format
0x000 - 0x3FF: data from our human badge.  Should be the same two messages over and over.
0x400 - 0x800: data from other badges.  Most files were dumped after recording a single badge type, so this region has the two messages from just that badge.
